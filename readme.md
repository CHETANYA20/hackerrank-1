My solutions to various HackerRank.com challenges. Some of the code may not be optimal or the most pythonic. My goal was to quickly write a solution that solved the challenge and was easy for anyone to read and understand. Also, I know that there are other/better ways to handle taking the input but in order to make my code more unique I've done things via the sys module. Eventually all of the very similar solutions may fall under their plagiarism checker.
